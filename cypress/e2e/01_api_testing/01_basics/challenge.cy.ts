// ⚠️ Database is seeded before each test. To take a look into what is going to be seeded

// challenge #1: Write a simple test to create a board check that the status code is correct
it('creates a board', () => {
  
});

// challenge #2: write a test for error status code. create a new card without providing boardId and listId. assert the error message
it('gets 400 when creating a card', () => {
  
});

// challenge #3: GET all the cards in list with id 1, use a query for that
it('gets all cards in list 1', () => {
